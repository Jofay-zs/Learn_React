In this project I'll create a react app about a car cocessionaire, aslo I will use tailwind for the styles. Keep in mind that I create this project with the main objective of learning react and tailwind.

If you want to install Tailwind in react I recommend you this [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app), just follow the instructions and everything will be fine.

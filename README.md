# Project01-Concessionaire
Project01-Concessionaire es un proyecto de una aplicacion para una empresa de manufacturacion de carros ficticia. Esta aplicacion se hizo con el fin de aprender y practicar algunas herramientas que mas adelante enumerare cuales son.

## About
In this project I try to simulate a manufaturing app for cars, a landing page is created where anyone can get in and find general information about the fictitios company, from this landing page you can access to a login form, which has implemented a 'signup' and 'forget my password' section. If you insert the correct credentials in the login, you will have acces to some interfaces for the admin, where you can do the full CRUD for the products(vehicles), users and sales sections. Besides that you can acces to a section where you can see and edit your profile.

## Languages and tools used
* I develop this page with React a JS library, which my knowledge was very little, but thanks to this project I was able to dig deeper.
* HTML
* CSS, for the styles I use Tailwind and for some components I use MaterialUI or custmon CSS styles.
* Node.js for the backend.
* MongoDB for the Data Base.
* Postman to probe and correct the petitions for the backend.
